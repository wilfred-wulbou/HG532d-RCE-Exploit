A Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit based on [CVE-2017-17215](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17215) vulnerability. Modded from original PoC code from [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43414) to work on  Huawei HG532d Home Gateway Routers.

## Description
This RCE exploit is based on CVE-2017-17215 which exploits vulnerabilities
in the UPnP process running on the Huawei HG532 series of home routers. The
original exploit from [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43414) targets HG532 Home Routers.

This exploit, with a mod done to the HTTP POST Request, bypasses the input 
sanitation done by the router - which allows the original exploit to 
work with HG532d routers.

Huawei HG532d with some customized versions has a remote code execution vulnerability. 
An authenticated attacker could send malicious packets to port 37215 to launch attacks.
